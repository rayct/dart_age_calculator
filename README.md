## Here's an example program in Dart that calculates a person's age and the number of days until their next birthday:

## This program will prompt the user for their date of birth, and then it will calculate current age, the day of the week you were born on, and the number of days until your next birthday.

## To use the program, simply run it in a IDE or code editor environment and follow the prompts.

# Version: 1.0.1
## Optimized version of the program:
## This version is similar to the previous version, but there are a few optimizations:

## 1. Used DateTime.tryParse instead of DateTime.parse to handle invalid input dates without throwing an exception.
## 2. Used DateTime.now().difference(birthDate).inDays ~/ 365 to calculate the age in years, which avoids using a floating-point division.
## 3. Used DateTime.isBefore instead of comparing dates with < to improve readability.
## 4. Used DateTime.difference to calculate the difference between dates in days.



# Version: 1.0
## This implementation uses the intl package to parse the date string and format the output strings. It also uses the DateTime class and its methods to calculate the age and days until the next birthday. To optimize the code, we could add error checking for invalid date inputs and add more efficient algorithms for calculating the age and days until the next birthday.
